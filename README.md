# LIRI

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


The app returns four types of information to the user:

    -Song information from Spotify

    -Movie information from OMDB

    -Concert information from Bands In Town

    -Random information from a random.txt file - it submits one of several options from the file and returns song, movie, or concert info.


To Use the application:

    User must run "node liri.js" on the command line.

    Select an option using the arrow keys and Enter.

    Enter a search term.

    View results and select another option.
